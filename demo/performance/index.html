      This tests the performance of <code>html</code> and <code>render</code>.
      By testing <em>only</em> these two functions, we isolate time spent by the
      templating engine from time spent by the element base class.

    <p>
      The term &ldquo;inject&rdquo; refers to the process of taking an array
      of template strings, injecting special markup strings, instantiating a
      <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element, mapping DOM elements based on the
      special markup previously injected, cloning that template element, and
      finally rendering it within a container element. Injection happens only
      <em>once per template function declaration</em>. This is the most
      time-consuming step of the process, but it also is only typically needed
      once per element base class definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term &ldquo;initial&rdquo; refers to the process of taking a
      template that&rsquo;s <em>already</em> been injected and rendering it into
      a new container element. For example, if you render multiple elements in
      the page, the templating function is likely shared &mdash; this means that
      the engine can skip the <em>injection</em> phase altogether. This happens
      whenever a new element of the same type is created (i.e., the same element
      appearing in a list over-and-over again).
    </p>
    <p>
      The term &ldquo;update&rdquo; refers to the process of changing the values
      which are interpolated into a given template. This is the most common
      thing the engine needs to do.
